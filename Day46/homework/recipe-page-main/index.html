        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>

      <div class="recipe__instructions">
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier omelette.</li>
          <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, or the oil is hot, pour in the egg mixture. Tilt the pan to ensure the egg mixture evenly coats the surface.</li>
          <li><strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set but are still slightly runny, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
          <li><strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully fold one half over the fillings. Once the omelette is cooked through and the fillings are heated, slide it onto a plate.</li>
          <li><strong>Enjoy immediately:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        </ol>
